# algotrace

A Claude skill that teaches data structures and algorithms by drawing every step.

![Claude Code skill](https://img.shields.io/badge/claude_code-skill-2563eb)


Most AI assistants take your almost-right solution and hand back a rewritten, fully correct one. You learn nothing. algotrace coaches by default, draws by default, and only gives complete code when you ask for it in plain words.

Four colors, fixed meanings, nothing else: blue is the pointer, green is found, red is eliminated, gray is processed.

## Install

```bash
git clone https: https://github.com/swapnil5053/algotrace.git
```

Open a Claude Code session and just talk to it — no commands, no setup:

```text
visualize binary search for 23 in [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
debug this: [your broken code] fails on [1,2,3,4,10], expected 14 got 7
I'm stuck on longest substring without repeating characters. do not spoil it.
```

Claude.ai users: upload `SKILL.md`, `modes/`, and `assets/style-contract.md` to a project's knowledge base and add "Follow SKILL.md" to its instructions.

## Modes

| Say this | Mode | Get this |
|---|---|---|
| "visualize binary search on [2,5,8,...]" | visualize | Frame-by-frame trace, inline or as an interactive step player |
| "explain monotonic stack" | tutor | Definition, intuition, small trace, pitfalls, one check question |
| "I'm stuck on LC 3, don't spoil it" | hint | Five levels — observation → pattern → invariant → technique → skeleton — one per message |
| paste code + "why does this fail?" | debug | The exact bug, proven with a trace to where your code diverges |
| "just give me the full code in Java" | solution | Clean, commented code with complexity — only on explicit ask |
| "mock interview me, medium, 45 min" | interview | Timed phases, hints that cost points, a scored rubric |
| "review day" | review | Spaced-repetition drills from your progress log, plus a weakness report |

Say "say it simply" anytime to drop the jargon — same frames, one plain-English analogy per term.

Debug mode is the core of this skill. It proves the bug with a trace, then the fix is one line:

```diff
-    for i in range(k, len(nums) - 1):
+    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
```

## Step players

Full walkthroughs compile into a single self-contained HTML file: prev/next/play, keyboard nav, playback speed, light/dark theme. Three ship in the repo:
`assets/visualizer-template.html` (binary search), `demos/sliding-window.html`, `demos/bfs-graph.html`.

| | algotrace | algo-sensei | peppermint | LeetCode Teacher |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Visualization | core, contractual | roadmap | ASCII, sometimes | none |
| Debug your own code | dedicated mode + proof trace | code review | post-submission feedback | none |

| Test input generator | yes, unit tested | roadmap | no | no |
| Enforced visual style | strict contract file | no | no | no |

Peppermint generates original problems and researches company-specific questions; Algotrace drills you on problems you bring. Use both if the problem with supply is your bottleneck.

## FAQ

**Why not just prompt Claude directly?** You can, and it drifts. The skill pins the behavior: one router, one format contract, guardrails that hold over long sessions.

**Will it refuse to give me the answer?** No — solution mode is one sentence away. It just won't hand it over while you're still asking for a hint.

Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript are first-class throughout.
